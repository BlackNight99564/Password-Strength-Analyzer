# Password Strength Analyzer (Web-Based)
** A simple web-based tool to analyze the strength of passwords based on length, character diversity, and complexity. This tool provides users with real-time feedback on how secure their passwords are, helping them create stronger and more secure passwords.

# Features
📏 Length Check: Evaluates passwords based on length to encourage strong passwords.
🔠 Character Diversity: Checks for a mix of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to ensure better security.
🔄 Real-Time Feedback: Instantly displays whether a password is Weak, Medium, or Strong as you type.
❌ Pattern Detection: Identifies weak patterns such as sequential numbers or repeated characters.
# How It Works
Enter a password in the input field of the web tool.
The analyzer evaluates the password based on:
Length
Use of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Presence of weak patterns like sequences (e.g., "1234") or repeated characters.
A visual indicator will show the password's strength:
# Weak 💡: Needs improvement.
# Medium 🔄: Acceptable, but can be stronger.
# Strong 💪: Excellent, with a good balance of length and complexity.
